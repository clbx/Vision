# Vision
Albion Vision Project

The Albion Vision Project is a WIP project to document what packets are sent between Albion and the Client. Also (will) include useful utilities.

# Installation
Download/Clone, Open in Visual Studio

**Put the following .dll's in the libs folder** (You will need to get them on your own, they are not too hard to get)
* PcapDotNet.Base.dll
* PcapDotNet.Core.dll
* PcapDotNet.Core.Extensiond.dll
* PcapDotNet.Packets.dll
* Photon3DotNet.dll
* Photon3Unity3D.dll

I've found that only Pcap version 1.0.4.1 works. So if you're having issues use that version.

# Legal

This is based off [AO-Radar](https://github.com/rafalfigura/AO-Radar) (which i have to mention due to GPL license). **The radar completely removed and is 100% inaccessible in this program**.


### Is this allowed?

Offically SBI allows the reading of packet data on the following conditions:

```
Our position is quite simple. As long as you just look and analyze we are ok with it. The moment you modify or manipulate something or somehow interfere with our services we will react (e.g. perma-ban, take legal action, whatever
```

C# isn't my most proficient language please be gentle.
